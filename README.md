## Instructions
### MAE
### MMSSL

We used Python 3.11.6 to run our code.
To set up a virtual environment and install the Python dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and create a new virtual environment using `venv`:
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required Python packages using `pip`:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


4. You are now ready to use the code and run the project. Set up the configuration in the config folder and then run the main file:
```
python run.py
```
